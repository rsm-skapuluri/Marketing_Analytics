randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\ntodo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\n\n# t-tests\nt.test(mrm2 ~ treatment, data = df)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  mrm2 by treatment\nt = -0.11953, df = 33394, p-value = 0.9049\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.2381015  0.2107298\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       12.99814        13.01183 \n\nt.test(female ~ treatment, data = df)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  female by treatment\nt = 1.7535, df = 32451, p-value = 0.07952\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.0008888548  0.0159826921\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n      0.2826978       0.2751509 \n\nt.test(years ~ treatment, data = df)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  years by treatment\nt = 1.0909, df = 32401, p-value = 0.2753\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.04584866  0.16094698\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n       6.135914        6.078365"

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nBalance Test\nTo verify the randomization, we tested whether the treatment and control groups differ significantly on a few pre-treatment characteristics.\nWe compared: - Months since last donation (mrm2) - Gender (female) (female) - Years since first donation (years)\nWe did this both using Welch two-sample t-tests and simple linear regressions, regressing each variable on the treatment indicator.\n\nT-Test Results:\n\nmrm2: p = 0.905 → no difference\nfemale: p = 0.080 → not significant at 95%, but somewhat close\nyears: p = 0.275 → no difference\n\n\n\nRegression Results:\n\nCoefficient on treatment for mrm2: 0.014 (p = 0.905)\nCoefficient on treatment for female: -0.0075 (p = 0.079)\nCoefficient on treatment for years: -0.058 (p = 0.27)\n\nThe results are consistent across both methods and match Table 1 in Karlan & List (2007) — there are no statistically significant differences, supporting the validity of the randomization process. This reassures us that any treatment effects we detect later are unlikely to be driven by pre-existing group differences.\n\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\n\n# Barplot: Proportion who donated by treatment status\ndf %&gt;%\n    group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n    summarise(response_rate = mean(gave)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(group = if_else(treatment == 1, \"Treatment\", \"Control\")) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = group, y = response_rate, fill = group)) +\n    geom_col(width = 0.5) +\n    labs(\n    title = \"Proportion of Individuals Who Donated\",\n    x = \"Group\",\n    y = \"Response Rate\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# T-test on donation rates\nt.test(gave ~ treatment, data = df)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by treatment\nt = -3.2095, df = 36577, p-value = 0.001331\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.006733310 -0.001627399\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n     0.01785821      0.02203857 \n\n# Linear regression (bivariate)\nsummary(lm(gave ~ treatment, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ treatment, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02204 -0.02204 -0.02204 -0.01786  0.98214 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This aligns with behavioral economics — people may perceive greater value or urgency when their contribution is effectively “worth more.” Even though the absolute change is small, it’s meaningful in a large-scale campaign context.\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n# Probit model: whether a donation was made ~ treatment assignment\nsummary(glm(gave ~ treatment, data = df, family = binomial(link = \"probit\")))\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), \n    data = df)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The matching offer increased donation likelihood. While the numerical change is small, in large-scale campaigns even modest increases in donor response rates can translate to substantial revenue gains.\nOverall, this analysis shows that matching offers matter — not necessarily because they increase each individual’s donation size, but because they nudge more people to give in the first place.\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\n\n# Filter treatment group only (exclude control)\ndf_ratio &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(ratio &gt; 0)\n\n# t-tests between match ratios\nt.test(gave ~ ratio, data = df_ratio %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(1, 2)))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by ratio\nt = -0.96505, df = 22225, p-value = 0.3345\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005711275  0.001942773\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1 mean in group 2 \n     0.02074912      0.02263338 \n\nt.test(gave ~ ratio, data = df_ratio %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(2, 3)))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by ratio\nt = -0.050116, df = 22261, p-value = 0.96\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 2 and group 3 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.004012044  0.003811996\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 2 mean in group 3 \n     0.02263338      0.02273340 \n\nt.test(gave ~ ratio, data = df_ratio %&gt;% filter(ratio %in% c(1, 3)))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by ratio\nt = -1.015, df = 22215, p-value = 0.3101\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 3 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.005816051  0.001847501\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1 mean in group 3 \n     0.02074912      0.02273340 \n\n\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression.

None of the differences were statistically significant at the 95% level: - $2:$1 vs $1:$1: p = 0.33 - $3:$1 vs $2:$1: p = 0.96 - $3:$1 vs $1:$1: p = 0.31\nThese results align with what Karlan & List (2007) state: “larger match ratios… had no additional impact.”\n\n\nRegression Results:\nI regressed gave on binary indicators for each match ratio. Using $3:$1 as the base group, both the $1:$1 and $2:$1 groups had slightly lower donation rates, but again, the differences were not statistically significant.\n\n$1:$1: –0.20 percentage points\n$2:$1: –0.01 percentage points\n\n\n\nDirect Comparison of Response Rates:\nFrom the raw data: - $1:$1 match: 2.07% response rate - $2:$1 match: 2.26% - $3:$1 match: 2.27%\nDifference between: - $2:$1 and $1:$1: +0.19 percentage points - $3:$1 and $2:$1: +0.01 percentage points\n\n\nConclusion:\nWhile all match treatments increased donation rates over the control group, larger match ratios didn’t generate additional gains. This challenges the common intuition among fundraisers that a bigger match is always more compelling. Instead, it seems that the presence of a match, rather than its size, is what nudges behavior.\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status.

I then took 10,000 differences between matched treatment and control values and plotted the cumulative average of those differences over time.\nThe resulting line converges smoothly to 0.004, which is the true difference in population probabilities. This confirms that as the number of samples increases, the average of the observed differences converges to the expected difference — illustrating the Law of Large Numbers.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nNext, I explored how the distribution of the sample mean differences changes as sample size increases. For sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000, I repeatedly took 1000 samples from each group, calculated the difference in means, and plotted histograms of those differences.\nWhat we observe: - For n = 50, the distribution is skewed and noisy. - By n = 200 and especially at n = 500 and 1000, the distributions are nearly normal and centered around the true difference (~0.004). - Most importantly, zero is in the tails, not the center, meaning we consistently detect a positive effect as sample size grows.\nThis is a clear visual example of the Central Limit Theorem: regardless of the underlying Bernoulli distribution, the sampling distribution of the difference in means becomes normal as n increases."
